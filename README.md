# Compilers Project 2026
This repository contains Group 5’s Compilers course project. We are building a compiler for a subset of the C language. For more details, see the project description [here](https://github.com/abems123/UAntwerpenResources/tree/main/Semester%204/Compilers/Projects).

# Notes
Always comment your code step per step in a clear language so that the other group members can understand your code, this way it will be easy for all of us to participate in the development of our compiler.

Please don't use AI all the time to generate code or grammar rules. AI should help us understand hard concepts and make it easier for us to grasp new things, but it shouldn't generate the whole project while we do nothing.
