# Compilers Project 2026
This repository contains Group 5’s Compilers course project. We are building a compiler for a subset of the C language. For more details, see the project description [here](https://github.com/abems123/UAntwerpenResources/tree/main/Semester%204/Compilers/Projects).

# Note
Always comment your code step per step in a clear language so that the other group members can understand your code, this way it will be easy for all of us to participate in the development of our compiler.
